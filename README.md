# DTMF and Tones Communication App for Mobile

Most mobile devices include a speaker and a microphone. This creates an opportunity to enable device-to-device (D2D) communication over audio that would work for almost 100% of the available devices in the market. Audio-based D2D would also enable any other devices with a speaker, such as a TV, FM radio, musical instruments, alarm systems, and so on to communicate directly with a personal mobile device without having to configure Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections. Audio-based D2D can also provide a more efficient and ubiquitous alternative to NFC-based communication used for a growing volume of mobile payment transactions and other emerging services. Tech giants have already started exploring the potentials of audio based D2D giving rise to new developments such as Google Tone, an extension of Chrome that lets nearby devices to share URLs over inaudible sound frequencies.
